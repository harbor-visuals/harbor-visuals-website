                <p>For a website project I did for the artist Floral Layne, we created film photos that beautifully complemented the artist's coastal and adventure-inspired paintings. Through the lens of analog cameras, we captured stunning images that echoed the spirit of exploration and wanderlust depicted in Floral Layne's artworks. The goal was to infuse the website with a cool retro aesthetic, seamlessly blending the timeless charm of analog photography with her unique style. The result is a visually engaging and cohesive online experience that transports visitors to the serene beauty of coastal landscapes, inviting them to immerse themselves in Floral Layne's captivating artistry."</p>

                <h3>Southern California: Photo Book</h3>
                <p>On a month-long adventure through the picturesque landscapes of California, I was on a mission to capture the essence of this iconic state. From the sun-kissed beaches of San Diego to the vibrant streets of Los Angeles, I immersed myself in the diverse tapestry of Californian life, documenting every moment with my trusty film cameras. Over the course of my journey, I shot more than 20 rolls of film, capturing the quintessential beauty of the West Coast.</p>
                <p>Upon my return, I meticulously curated the best shots and transformed them into a stunning photo book, allowing viewers to experience the magic of California through my lens. Filled with vibrant images and heartfelt moments, this photo book serves as a visual love letter to the Golden State, capturing the spirit of adventure and discovery that defines this iconic destination."</p>

                <h3>Monochrome Majesty: London</h3>
                <p>During a brief but immersive weekend excursion to London, my objective was clear: to encapsulate the city's allure using solely black and white film. London, with its rich tapestry of historic landmarks and architectural marvels, provided the ideal backdrop for this monochromatic exploration.</p>
                <p>As I roamed the cobblestone streets and iconic neighborhoods, I sought out the timeless beauty hidden within each scene. The absence of color allowed me to focus on the intricate details and textures of London's historic buildings, creating a truly unique perspective on the city's essence.</p>
