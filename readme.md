# Harbor Visuals Portfolio Website

Semester submission in the Web Development Basics module of the "Web Design and Development" course at SAE Zurich.

I decided to create a portfolio website for my own work. I designed and developed it completely by myself, with feedback from our lectures.

## Description SAE Project

The aim of the "Web Development Basics" module is to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Many exercises were carried out throughout the semester.
After the many practical exercises, the final submission of this semester was possible. The topic could be chosen by the students themselves and had to be aligned with the framework conditions of the school. The goal was to develop a fully responsive website based on the planning (goals, wireframes, screen designs, etc.) in the previous semester in the "Web Design Fundamentals" module.

## My Project

### Description

The goal is to design a modern and timeless portfolio website showcasing my previous
work and projects in photography, videography, graphic and web design. The website
should have a good balance between all the different styles and projects I have done in
the past.

The website is intended to present my skills in the field of “Content Creation”. It should
appeal to potential clients and future employers. The website should not only show the
end result of the projects, but also the story behind them and the process of how the
results were achieved.

The website is intended to appeal to private and business clients. The photography and
videography section is intended to help private and business clients understand my
style and see my work. The graphic and web design, on the other hand, is aimed more at
business clients.

The vision and style of the Harbor Visuals brand should be recognizable on all channels
and extend seamlessly from the website to various social media platforms such as Instagram,
YouTube and beyond.

## Concept

A concept was developed in preparation for this project. This concept included all relevant topics that are important when planning a website.
The concept was the basis for this development project and was to be implemented as well and as closely as possible.
